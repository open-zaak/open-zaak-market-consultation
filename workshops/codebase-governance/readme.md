### Breakout workshops:

Breakout into two groups for collaborative working sessions  

09:40 - 09:45 Introduction to miro and the cards  
09:45 - 10:20 Round 1: Formulating governance  
      1.1) Fork or push: What is your understanding of a shared OpenZaak codebase?  
      1.2) Start with governance game, attempting to map out and discuss governance.md as is
    
10:20 - 10:25 Break  
    
10:25 - 11:00 Round 2: Testing governance  
    2) Stress test scenarios  
        2.1) Vendor determines a severe security issue affecting everyone using openzaak codebase components. The vendor creates a fix and pushes this fix upstream to the central repository. How will others get this fix?  
        2.2) There is a disagreement about the technical roadmap, one vendor is threatening to make a hard fork, what does the rest of the community do?  
        2.3) A new functionality breaks compatability with older release?  
          
11:00 - 11:30 Round 3: Learnings and reflections - drafting and creating issues on governance.md

### Closing
